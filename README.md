This is my final project for BIOSTAT 823. The goal of this study is to compare the efficiency of various matrix algebra computations across base R and RcppEigen.

The R version used is: R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23)

The packages used to complete this analysis are:
-tidyverse
-RcppEigen
-microbenchmark
-foreach
-flextable
-reshape2
-ggpubr
